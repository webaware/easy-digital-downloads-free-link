replace EDD add-to-cart button with download link when product is free

## Description

Replace the add-to-cart button in [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) with a direct link to the download file when the product is free and has only one file. This only works when the file is an external link to a web-accessible file.

For archive pages on the [Shop Front theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/shop-front), the cart icon is replaced with a download icon and direct download link.

Want to see it in action? Check out the [WebAware shop](https://shop.webaware.com.au/) -- it's running this plugin.

## Installation

1. Either install automatically through the WordPress admin, or download the .zip file, unzip to a folder, and upload the folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory. Read [Installing Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) in the WordPress Codex for details.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why?

Because I wanted to add my free plugins to an Easy Digital Downloads shop, without making it harder to download them from the shop than from WordPress.org plugin pages.

### Are downloads logged in Easy Digital Downloads?

No. Downloads are direct from the site hosting the linked file.

### Can I change the download link label?

Yes, see Downloads > Settings > Extensions. There's also a filter hook, `edd_free_link_label`, if you want finer control over the link label.

### Can I change the download link HTML?

Yes, there are templates. Look in the templates folder of the plugin. There's also a filter hook, `edd_free_link_template`, if you want finer control over which template is used.
